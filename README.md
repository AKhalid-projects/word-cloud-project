# word-cloud-project
This was the final project in the [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course) course.
For this project, we created a “word cloud” from a text by writing a python script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.
